I'm a seasoned software developer with a decade of experience specializing in crafting innovative user interfaces.

**My expertise lies in front-end development**, where I excel in analyzing requirements and designing customized technical solutions using React, SingleSPA, Mobx, and other leading frameworks. I seamlessly integrate frontend and backend technologies to ensure optimal user experiences.

My journey began when I received my first Personal Computer, based on the 8086, at the age of 8. Despite spending half of my career in Design, UX, and Agile positions, **I returned to my first love, coding**.

**I proudly manage my personal brand**, Right Right, where I create digital products by harmonizing design, management, and coding aspects
